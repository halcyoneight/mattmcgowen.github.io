        <p>Matt took up the guitar when he was ten years old. He would sit for hours listening to his parents old LP records and attempt to reproduce some of the tunes on the instrument.. not always with great success! At about fifteen Matt learned some rudimentary drums and became a drummer in a highschool rock band playing Iva Davies and Bon Jovi covers. With a taste for performing Matt then started his own high school rock band where he would sing and play rhythym guitar to school audiences and at high school parties. matt was joined in these performances by his brother Jared who would also play guitar and occasionally sing. The pair fought like cats and dogs but always ultimately enjoyed the experience of performing together.</p>

        <p>Songwriting didn't come easily at first to matt but when it did it came in a torrent with matt completing about 50 compositions in his first songwriting year.</p>

        <p>After leaving high school soon put a band together 'the melancholy angels' - playing live gigs in both sydney and melbourne Matt gained great experience and an understanding of how hard it was to get a band off the ground with a lack of funding (a problem that so many artists experience when starting out). Desperate for funding ...matt then spent a year studying property and together with his mother Juliana built a highly successful property business (all the while working on his music at night and at every other opportunity).</p>

        <p>Thru commitment and dedication matt has now been now able to fulfil his dream of producing a album of the highest standard without compromising on quality. matt has accessed some of the most sought after producers, musicians and engineers in the country and overseas to help make this album something really special.</p>

        <p>Production time for the project ran out to 14 or so months. And took Matt literally around the globe from Sydney to New York City. The album was produced by acccomplished and sought after producer Steve James (Paul Young),(Aria award winning producer and engineer 2001) and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound NYC. (Nora Jones, The Eagles)</p>

        <p>According to industry and other people both here in Australia and the US the potential "stand out" tracks for single release are "My Tomorrow, Japan and Revelation".</p>

        <p>Matt seems to have the whole package, the looks, the song writing ability and a great acoustic sounding mix of music - matt has an ever building fan base which come along and see him perform live at gigs and are kept informed about what is happening through our <a href="contact.html">email mailing list</a>.</p>
